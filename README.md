# Smart Sorting: AI-Powered Produce Quality Detection

## Overview

Smart Sorting is an innovative project focused on enhancing the precision and efficiency of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained VGG16 deep learning models and adapting them to specific datasets of fruits and vegetables, this project aims to revolutionize the process of sorting and quality control in the agricultural and food industry.

## Features

- **99.2% Accuracy**: High-precision classification using VGG16 transfer learning
- **28 Produce Classes**: Supports detection of 28 different fruits and vegetables
- **Real-time Processing**: Process thousands of images per minute
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Flask web application
- **Production Ready**: Scalable system designed for industrial deployment

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Anaconda Navigator (recommended)
- 8GB+ RAM for model training
- GPU support (optional, for faster training)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd smart-sorting
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n smart-sorting python=3.8
   conda activate smart-sorting
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the trained model**
   - Place `healthy_vs_rotten.h5` in the root directory
   - Or train your own model using the provided dataset

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the upload area or drag and drop an image
2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Image" button to process the image
3. **View Results**: See the classification results with confidence scores
4. **Interpretation**: 
   - Green results indicate fresh produce
   - Red results indicate rotten produce
   - Confidence scores show model certainty

### API Endpoints

- `POST /predict`: Upload image for analysis
- `POST /api/predict`: JSON API for predictions
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

## Model Architecture

### VGG16 Transfer Learning

- **Base Model**: Pre-trained VGG16 on ImageNet
- **Input Size**: 224x224x3 RGB images
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom classification layers for 28 produce classes
